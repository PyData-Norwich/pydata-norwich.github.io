## Presentations

### John Haidoulis - **Effective Experimental Design and Data Analysis in Biosciences**

This talk will provide an overview of the key stages involved in designing experiments, analysing and visualising biological data. We’ll dive into hands-on examples from plant science, including essential tools, programming languages & libraries, and statistical methods that are typically used. We will then briefly discuss the emerging integration of machine learning in the biological research pipeline

### Giancarlo Erra *(Altaire)* - **From Prompts to Production: what businesses ask about AI**

Businesses are committed to AI adoption—with 78% of global companies now utilising AI—but the transition from "Prompts to Production" is currently stalled by organisational barriers, chiefly a lack of skills (50%) and a lack of vision among managers (43%). The technical imperative is therefore to drive pragmatic change by prioritising workforce upskilling (planned by 85% of employers) and the automation of processes (73%), focusing on empowering non-technical users from basic prompt engineering toward integrated, iterative solutions.
