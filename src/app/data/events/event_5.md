## Details

Join us for an evening of Python/Data Science related talks and discussion.

This is a very informal event where we will have a couple of 30 mins presentations (see details below) with plenty of room for questions. Afterwards we'll take a trip to the local pub for anyone that wants to come along.

## Presentations

### 1. Mike Joyner *(Hartree Partners / Bricks & Logic)* - Predicting house prices without machine learning

When data quality is low and transparency and explainability is key, why a statistical based approach rather than traditional machine learning methods leads to more effective results

### 2. Richard Bensley *(MariaDB)* - Map, filter, and reduce, then and now

A quick look at what was originally implemented and how they have changed.
