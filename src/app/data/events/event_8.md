# Get together / Website ideas

## Date

2025-07-22

## Details 

Welcome back to PyData Norwich (Formerly Data Science Norfolk). After a bit of a hiatus we have returned under the PyData umbrella!!

This event is primarily a chance to meet up again and discuss what's been going on in Python/Data Science recently. However a number of people have raised the possibility of having a website related to the group to help with things like

- Getting started in both Python and Data Science and how to improve those skills.
- Advice and tips when looking for jobs.
- Knowing where to find useful resources.

The plan is therefore to have some informal discussions about what would be useful and crowdsource some suggestions of relevant content (mainly links to good resources) tailored to Norwich.

If you do not wish to contribute or feel you don't have the experience you are still very welcome to join and listen to the discussions, Late-comers are also welcome.

Afterwards we will go to the pub!
