# PyData Norwich - October Meetup (Workshop)

## Date

2025-10-20

## Workshop

### Ben Askew-Gale *(Natwest)* - **Python Software Design Workshop**

As your Python programs grow and become more complex, they can quickly become hard to maintain, extend and reason about. Software design patterns help keep this complexity under control, making your code more understable and facilitating the scaling to larger applications.

In this workshop, we will take some bad Python code and refactor it step by step. You will learn to spot primitive obsession, replace conditionals with the Strategy pattern, and use Dependency Injection to write testable code.
