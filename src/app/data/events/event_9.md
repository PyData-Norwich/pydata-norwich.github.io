## Presentations

### Dr Gabriel Harris *(NIQ Brandbank)* - **Modern Tools for Python Development: Code for Collaboration**

Data science projects are often messy with inconsistent environments and dependencies, and individual coding preferences. These challenges undermine reproducibility, code quality, and ultimately slow down collaboration. In this talk I will go through some of my best Python development tools and show you how they can automate much of the boilerplate work and enforce consistency and best practices across your team. These include:

- uv to install and manage Python versions, virtual environments, and dependencies
- pyproject.toml to isolate dependency groups and add tools configurations
- Ruff to line and format code
- pre-commit to manage Git pre-commit hooks
- Bonus: dev containers
