## Presentations

### 1. Kev Sturman (Kaarbontech) - Harnessing the Power of Infrastructure as Code: Building with AWS CDK and Python.

Explore the capabilities of AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with Python, define and deploy cloud infrastructure using code.

### 2. Chris Ballard (Justified AI) - Few shot learning with SetFit

Training a machine learning model normally requires labelled data. In this talk, Chris will talk about how you can train a model when labelled data is scarce, discussing the different techniques that can be used in this situation. He will introduce an approach called SetFit and how it can be used to train models that can be efficiently deployed in production.
