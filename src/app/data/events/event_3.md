## Presentations

### 1. Mark Harvey *(Maplecroft)* - Generating reliable libraries (with uv and nox)

An overview of how to ensure reliable backwards compatible libraries with tooling such as uv and nox

### 2. Yogi Louise Bear *(Freelance Machine Learning Engineer)* - Using NLP, graph theory, and qualitative approaches to identify markers of radicalisation in online conversations.

This talk will summarise a recent machine learning project which sought to recognise the roles individuals play in online conversations that lead to either radicalisation or the incitation of violence at large-scale events such as protests. The intention is to understand how extreme online discord operates with a view to using the information to prevent future negative events.
